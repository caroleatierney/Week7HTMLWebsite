# Week7HTMLWebsite: Website built with strictly html

## The website needs:
- at least 3 pages with navigation on all of them
- 2 different size headers
- a list
- 3 images
- a table
- a form

### This website uses images I have stored in Imgur:

### I borrowed In Easy Steps HTML from the Library for ideas and hints
